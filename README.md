Adaptive grey wolf optimization (GWO) for path planning involves using the GWO meta-heuristic algorithm,
enhanced with adaptive mechanisms to better balance global exploration and local exploitation,
thereby improving its ability to find optimal or near-optimal paths for agents like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
